# tag

Platformer-based tag game set in a city based on the cityscape artwork.

## Gameplay
Player vs AI or player vs player. Players can hide behind buildings. Stamina bar (not shown) where leading player has slightly less. Animation and freeze for tagged player when tagged to give other player a headstart.

## Movement
Players move left, right, jump and switch between layers. Slide and swing potentially. Animations for movement -- e.g. dust.

## World
Trains and cars move. Trains cause world to shake slightly so hiding players become shown. Clouds should animate. Lights should flicker. Sun should rise.

## Score and sound
Celeste like but less ambitious.

## MVP
One level. 2D only with one layer. Basic AI. Export to html5.

## Todo / issues
- AI sometimes get stuck
